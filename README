c25km: A 'Couch To 5K' app for Maemo and Android mobile devices, written
in Python.

This app helps you keep track of your workout routine. It's simple, but has
some useful features:

	- Keeps track of what your last week/workout was
	- Reports distance travelled per workout (when using GPS)
	- Visual and audible cues, telling you when to jog and when to walk
	- Large UI suitable for touchscreens, scales to fit resolution

ESSENTIAL DEPENDENCIES:
	python >= 2.6 (Maemo has this; does Android?)
	pygame

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:
	python-location (Needs to be installed from Maemo repositories)
	gobject
	psyco (Probably not available for Maemo/Android pythons)
	espeak/festival/flite (For audible cues)

TO RUN:
	cd c25km/
	python -OO c25km.py

The application is fullscreen (at least on Maemo).
Choose which week and workout you want to start on, and click 'Start!' in the
top-left-hand corner. If you have GPS enabled, it will automatically start
tracking your location/distance travelled when you click Start.

The app might seem slightly unresponsive to touch input; this is deliberate.
I've put a 1-second delay in the main program loop, to save CPU and therefore
battery on mobile devices.
